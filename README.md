## Project:
I solved the task given in the Kaggle Competion at https://www.kaggle.com/c/contradictory-my-dear-watson 
>Your task is to create an NLI model that assigns labels of 0, 1, or 2 (corresponding to entailment, neutral, and contradiction) to pairs of premises and hypotheses.
To make things more interesting, the train and test set include text in fifteen different languages!

The goal of the project was to use test different pre-trained transformer-based multilingual models, in this case BERT and RoBERTa.
Models from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co) were used.
